# Graphics with OpenGL

I will be attempting to put some shapes on the screen using the `C++` library [**OpenGL**](https://www.opengl.org/).  

This library is really an interface between the code and a computer's graphics.  

I have never used this before so just looking to get something to work...

## Usage

Project can be built using `make all` and run under `\bin` with `.\bin\program.exe`  

Issues can sometimes be solve by rebuilding with `make clean` then `make all`  

## Dependencies

```make
gl.h    // Open Graphics Library
glut.h  // GL Utility Toolkit
glfw.h  // Graphics Library Framework
glew.h  // OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library
```

*Located in `\lib`*
